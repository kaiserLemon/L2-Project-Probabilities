# Project_probabilities
Study of different probability distributions in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

- The first report analyzes graphically the difference between the cumulative distribution functions of the binomial distribution and Poisson distribution.
The main idea is to show that Poisson distribution can be a good approximation of the binomial distribution under certain conditions specified in the report.

- The second report aims to simulate a pseudo-random generator (perfectly random would be impossible because of the deterministic nature of a computer). Then, we represent the data found in the form of a histogram and draw different conclusions specified in the report once again :)
